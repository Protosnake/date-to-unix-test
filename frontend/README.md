# Frontend service

This is a sub-module that contains a simple frontend application for the Unix to Date converter. The application allows users to input a Unix timestamp and converts it to a human-readable date format. It handles both valid and invalid inputs gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

## Installation

`nvm use` or `nvm install` if you don't have the right version
`npm install`

## Running the Application

To start the frontend application, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the application in development mode. You can then access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
